    <p>In general, all our group members’ ideal jobs relate to the IT field and are very similar. Apart from John Huynh who is pursuing a career of being a business analyst. Everybody else in the group is pursuing a very IT dependent career that will require strong foundations and advanced learning in coding, IT infrastructure and computer systems. Terrence and Mohamed are both pursuing careers that are very similar being system admin and IT manager. Mohamed Abdallah is also pursuing a path of entrepreneurship and innovating his own product of a home automation device. Most of our members have communication skills and a basic understanding of IT coding. However, all our members need to improve and further advance their knowledge and skills in IT infrastructures and coding. The learning plan for our group members mainly consists of going through with their university courses and modules to learn the necessary skills needed for their ideal job and then getting themselves into the industry with placements or internships.</p>

    <h2>Industry Data</h2>
    <h3> Job titles and industry demand:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Tony Villani</h4> <p>Tony's ideal position is the role of IT systems administrator. Providing technical support for general-purpose IT systems and networks could be categorised as a system administrator's job. The field of IT system administration is an expanding profession. The Bureau of Labour and Statistics (BLS) projects that between 2018 and 2028, there will be a 5% growth in the number of people employed in the field of IT system administration [1]. Over a ten-year period, that represents a rise of more than 18,000 employment. This figure excludes occupations created to replace the more than 383,000 sysadmin positions that are currently in existence [1].</p></li>
        <li><h4>Terrence Taylor</h4><p>Terrence also desires to work as a System Admin/IT Manager position, which handles a variety of duties. A system administrators’ job is to provide technical support for generic IT systems and networks might be used to classify these duties. Employers are looking for a qualified professional that can handle a range of duties. Employers want someone who can provide general IT technical assistance and maintain a company's current software process. With strong emphasis on three software’s: WHMCS, Xero, and WorkFlowMax. On the network side, employers require the potential applicants to maintain a VMware server that hosts unique websites. This is to guarantee the safety of the network's backup systems. The Bureau of Labour and Statistics (BLS) expects,” a five percent increase in system administrator jobs between 2018 and 2028”[1].</p></li>
        <li><h4>Mohamed Mohamed</h4><p>Mohamed’s preferred position is to work for the position as the IT Network Administrator. A network administrator's job is to maintain and make sure that an organisation's IT systems are working properly. It's a challenging job that involves working with people, from many different departments. This position requires individuals to identify issues that affect many different pieces of hardware or software. Local-area networks (LANs), wide-area networks (WANs), and other forms of networks are the responsibility of network administrators. Employers insist on employees who have strong communication, interpersonal and leadership skills. Employers want someone who could help the company adopt advanced systems for data storage and other operations. Also, this profession is “expected to grow by about 6% from 2016 through 2026”, from the Bureau of Labour statistics report[5].</p></li>
        <li><h4>Haider Alkhalkhali</h4> <p>Haider Alkhalkhali's desirable position is to work as a machine learning engineer. This position would give him the opportunity to develop his skills in this area. In this field, machine learning engineers utilise pre-existing algorithms and statistical techniques to either classify already-existing massive amounts of information or anticipate how a set of data will look in the future. This domain would give him the opportunity to develop his skills in this area, because he would receive training for duties that will demand such expertise in the future.  This through the usage of Python, SQL, and machine learning. The need for both Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) talents will increase at a compounded pace of “71% through 2025”, according to the Top 10 Tech Job Skills Predicted to Grow the Fastest in 2021 report [6].</p></li>
        <li><h4>Mohamad Abdallah</h4><p>Mohamed Abdallah wants to work as a home automation business owner. This job will require him to have advanced proficiency in creating a business website (marketing purposes). Employers demand the ability to collaborate with other corporations, as well as superior marketing abilities.  He will also need to have an advanced understanding of SQL database configuration and programming.  Employers also require the skill to create a website for the company, so that the business could run smoothly.  The report by Fortune Business Insights indicates a “compound annual growth rate of 12.3% [7]”.Therefore, there is going to be a huge investment in the future for devices that are connected to IoT (Internet of Things). </p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Skills required for these jobs:</h3>
    <p>Both Network administrators and IT system administrators are very similar, because they must be able to use a wide range of skills and experience to carry out their daily job. In our group, we have Terrence Taylor, Tony Villani, and Mohamed Mohamed who want to work as both these professional roles. IT system administrators and Network administrators will generally need to have; great writing and communication abilities, the ability to perform well under pressure and be able to overcome challenges [3]. Additionally, you will need to have previous experience and knowledge of IT-related abilities to work as an IT system administrator. For this job, networking, cloud, and SQL management expertise are essential [2]. Other technical skills employers demand include troubleshooting techniques, computer hardware, and addressing software issues that the company may have. Haider would hopefully want to work as a machine learning engineer. He will need technical expertise in programming and machine learning techniques. He needs these abilities because they will enable him to create software components with less need for human oversight. To perform more effectively, a machine learning engineer also needs good communication skills. For you to effectively communicate these insights to a non-technical staff, your shareholders, or clients, you'll need good communication skills. Mohamed Abdallah’s ideal position is to become a business owner in the home automation industry. He will need strong skills in troubleshooting and programming many different software and equipment. He will work with many different equipment-like computers, applications, and remote controls. For this reason, he must possess extraordinary technical abilities to install the systems in a way that meets the needs of the client. Along with his job-related talents, he will also need interpersonal skills. These abilities include anything from attitude and empathy to listening and communication.</p>

    <h3>How do these skills rank in terms of the current demand?</h3>
    <p>Network administrators require many different skills that are demanded from employers. These skills include IT-specific knowledge of network and systems management, software, and hardware. A desire to always push yourself to learn, adapt, and develop are general skills required for the position of network administrator. Also, employers look for applicants that have excellent written and verbal communication abilities.</p>

    <h3>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set? </h3>
    <p>The top three IT-related qualities that are desired by employers but are not requirements are machine learning, cloud computing, and mobile application expertise. Although not necessary, these abilities are nevertheless valuable. The fact that new technology is constantly being introduced in business, means that you will need to stay up to date on the latest technological developments, which means you will also acquire new skills to learn.
        Having a strong work ethic, being able to perform well in a team atmosphere, and having a pleasant attitude at work are the top three general qualities that are desirable but not required. These general skills are transferable soft skills that influence how well you interact with and relate to different people in the workplace, these skills are highly desired by employers.
    </p>

    <h3>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h3>
    <p>The Burning Glass data displays on a bar graph the highly sought-after skills. Employers are looking for applicants with outstanding communication, problem-solving, and troubleshooting abilities. Since a network administrator position requires all the aforementioned skills, my preferred career path hasn't altered. In 2021, adaptability, communication, and creative problem-solving skills were the most in-demand abilities [4].  My ideal career requires all these qualities, and companies are constantly on the lookout for those who have the similar skillset.</p>
